:: This script installs/upgrades everything needed to compile Inkscape on Windows with one click.
:: It automates the dependency installation described on the "Compiling Inkscape on Windows" wiki page.
:: See the "echo" lines at the start of the script for details.
:: 
:: Limitations:
:: - Only suitable for interactive use because it asks for user input in a few cases (before script exit, and at certain errors).
:: - Error checking is not implemented, the script will often just silently try to continue.
:: - Only for MINGW64 (x86_64) architecture
::
:: To run the script, just double-click on the windows-deps-clickHere.bat file.
